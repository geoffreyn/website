                    | This figure is based on the search term "I would like a straight fit pair of jeans that fit well."
                    | It shows the top results when comparing this string to the text of each Amazon.com review for "Clothing & Accessories" products collected over a period of 18 years.  
                    | Each product can have multiple reviews, so the same product can be matched to the string multiple times if the reviews have similar words in them.
                    | The products that occur in the top 300 matches (In this case the same products had 10-all words matched in at least 20 of those top 300 reviews) are sorted by number of matches.  
                    | Additionally, the repeat products in the bottom 300 matches (0-1 words matched) are shown for comparison.
