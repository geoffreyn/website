                    | This figure shows the amount of times the search term "I would like a straight fit pair of jeans that fit well."
                    | occurs in Amazon.com reviews for "Clothing & Accessories" over a period of 18 years.  
                    | 581,933 reviews were compared.
                    | This suggests the viability of separating out a few products that match the string well from those product reviews with fewer word matches, since a small fraction of the reviews contain all of the words in the search phrase (47 out of 581,933 product reviews contain all of the search terms: 0.0081%; 1955 contain 10 or more of the words: 0.3359%).
